# Description

After observing the difficulty in finding a suitable wedding budgeter online, or as well in the mess of making one's own Googlesheet, we created Monnaie. Monnaie provides users a means of planning and budgeting their weddings. Our plan is to allow users to search our database for vendors, create task lists, add/edit/delete items, services, or other descriptions to a total estimated or actual budget, and see these changes displayed as graphs. Users must create a personal account to sign in with, and can see their summary on a personal page. 

## Future plans

- A community board where users can share their wedding budget details with others, and interact/post Q&A's
- Dark and light mode option
- Guest list feature
- Bids/vendor contact information, sign-up pages for them

## Languages used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JSX

## Deployment

- [Heroku](https://monnaie-v2.herokuapp.com/)

## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
